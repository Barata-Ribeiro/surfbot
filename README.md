# Surfbot

This is a website developed from scratch for a fictional surfing school. The design of the website was created during the "Advanced UI Design" course from [origamid.com](https://www.origamid.com). The course's instructor created the design to teach advanced UI design techniques. I wrote the code on my own to consolidate the learning process from other classes.

## Demo

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Interactive navigation and burger menu
- About the beach and the school
- Contact form
- Payment page with form for personal info and payment method

## Known Limitations

Due to the need for a hosting service, some functionalities that require PHP will not work. As a result, some forms may not have full functionality. The `index.html` contact form uses the [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co) free API but won't work because the surfing school's email is fictitious.
